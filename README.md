This is a command-line Hangman game developed in Python, designed to showcase core programming skills including control flow, string manipulation, and basic game logic. The game challenges players to guess a hidden word one letter at a time, with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed.

Players begin with 7 lives and must uncover a randomly selected word by entering one letter per turn. With each incorrect guess, a life is lost, bringing the player closer to losing the game. The current state of the word is displayed after each guess, using dashes for unknown letters and revealing correct guesses in their appropriate positions. Used letters are tracked and displayed to help prevent repeated guesses.

This project demonstrates my understanding of:

Python fundamentals (loops, conditionals, lists, and string operations)

User interaction via terminal input and output

Game loop design and input validation

Simple user interface and feedback

The code is structured clearly for readability and maintainability. It includes error handling for repeated or invalid inputs and maintains consistent gameplay until the word is fully guessed or the player runs out of lives.

This project reflects my ability to apply problem-solving techniques and implement engaging interactive experiences using Python. It can be easily expanded with additional features like word difficulty levels, ASCII art for visual representation of the hangman, or importing word lists from external files.
